    [Remarks ] : here this component products is huge(too large) we will see how we can decompose it.

    among the good pratice of dev is to decompose your component. when you develop it is necessary to decompose your component
    into small components to facilitate maintenance and testing but also to facilitate reuse.
    
    1- Products component will be decomposed in Products-list + products-nav-bar
    
    2- Path : Products = Products/products-list + Products/Products-nav-bar 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->



<app-products-nav-bar (NavbarEventEmitter)="onActiveEvent($event)"></app-products-nav-bar> 
<app-product-list [_childItemIput$]="_products$" (childItemOutputEvenEmitter)="onActiveEvent($event)"></app-product-list>
<!-- //if products variable change to become a Observable Variable, then its vew side representation also change// -->
